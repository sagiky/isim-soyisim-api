# isim-soyisim-api
 This is a test project I created to understand how to build an API with the Express module, written in Node.js. It offers nothing crazy at all. The json list only has Turkish names.

## TO DO LIST
 1. Use async and await in the code (make it more optimized) -[]
 2. Extend the JSON list. -[]
 3. Change the names to English... maybe? -[]
